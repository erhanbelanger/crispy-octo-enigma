# This website's main focus was to highlight my ability to use responsive css and showcase my ability to design a website

# I have gone through multiple design changes while perfecting my portfolio website in which I will add projects to as we go along and I create them

# this portfolio website will be my resume post graduation that will hopefully allow me to gather a job

# this readme, solidifies that this is my code and nobody else's my mission was to create an immense portfolio that can allow future employers to see my skillset prior to gettting a coding interview

# the main project is the largest one/most recent, that I would like my future emplyer to see

# this website in unique to me due to the coloring and style I have picked, I believe it shows my creative elements as much as possible
